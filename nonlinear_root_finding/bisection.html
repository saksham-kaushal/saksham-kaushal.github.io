Bisection method for finding roots of non-linear function equations gets on with its work just like Binary search does for searching in a sorted array. Two initial guesses are provided which act as bounds for finding the root. The initial guesses play an important role here (more on that later). The function is evaluated at the mid point. If the point evaluated to one of the roots of the equation, the solution is accepted; else, a hint is taken whether the root lies in the left half or the right half of the interval, and based on that hint, either of the two halves is selected. Then, for the next iteration of root finding, the function is futher evaluated at the mid point of the selected half in a similar fashion. This is done till a root is encountered within permissible error limits.

The initial guesses of the bounds should be made smartly in order for algorithm to converge. If the function evaluates to a negative value at one point and to a positive value at another, the function should evaluate to zero somewhere in the interval, provided,
(a) the function is continuous,
(b) the function does not contain a point of singularity within the interval.
(Convergence to point of singularity can be easily identified by unexpectedly large evaluations of the function at those points, instead of obtaing a zero.)
Thus, such points can be considered as bounds for bracketing the interval.

Once the initial guesses for the 2 points are made, the function is evaluated at the mid point of the interval. If, within permissible error limits, the mid point evaluates to a root of the function, the value of that point is accepted as the root, and returned by the program. If that does not happen (a more likely case), the value of function is evaluated at that point. 
(a) If the value of function is positive, the point replaces the previous bound evaluated to positive value to become the new bound.
(b) If the value of function is negative, the point replaces the previous bound evaluated to negative value to become the new bound.
The function is then evaluated at the mid point of the new bounds over and over again till a mid point of some interval gives us the value of the root within the permissible error limits.
