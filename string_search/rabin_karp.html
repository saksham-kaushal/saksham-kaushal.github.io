			Rabin Karp Algorithm

#####################################################################

Careful analysisof bruteforce algorithm makes us realize that a
lot of useless comparisons are made. Instead, hashing technique
can be implemented to improve efficiency by reducing the number
of comparisons.

In hashing, we use a function -hash function- to map a string to
some integer value. For example, using function 

		f(x)=2x+3,

and using values x("A")=2, x("B")=5 and x("C")=7, the hash function
yields us values f("A")=7, f("B")=13 and f("C")=17. This way, A, B
and C map to different integer values.

Now on, let us consider using ASCII values of characters as their
corresponding integer values in our hash function, i.e. 
x(char)= ASCII value of char. This way,

"L" maps to 76
"O" maps to 79
"W" maps to 87

If we consider adding these value to get values for corresponding
strings of these characters, the string "LOW" maps to 76+79+87=241.
But, so does the string "OWL" map to.

Such condition is called COLLISION, where 2 or more strings map to
same value computed using hash function. To avoid collisions, we will
later improve our hash function after understanding why collisions
needtobe reduced.

In Rabin-Karp algorithm, we compute the hash of the pattern string
having length m. Now, we begin by computing hash value for first m
characters of the text (indexes 0 to m-1). If the hash of this text
slice of length same as that of pattern is equal tohash of pattern,
we compare each corresponding element of both strings to see if they
match and return the index if they do. If the hashes are not equal,
we compute the hash of elements of text from index 1 to m (assuming
indexes of pattern start at 0 and end at m-1). ifthe hashes still do
not equate, we compute hash for elemts of indexes 2 to m+1, then 
3 to m+3 and so on, till a match occurs or searching text string
finishes.

The computation of subsequent hash values can be compute using
previously computed hash values by implementing the concept of rolling
hash.This can be done by subtracting some precalculated value from
privious hash and adding the value corresponding to new element.
For example,
	in SAME
		SAM maps to 83+65+77=225
		AME maps to value computes as follows:
			hash("AME")= hash("SAM")-hash(S)+hash(E)
				   = 225-83+69 = 211

When comparing two hashes, if the hashes are equal, we compare the 
strings. This is done because collisions occur. If somehow we are
able to devise a simple collision-free hash function, we do not need
to compare the strings. But in reality, collisions are natural (often
because of huge amount of data accompanied by memory constraints). So,
we try to reduce them without compromising the simplicity of hash
function, so that not too much of processing power goes is consumed
in its computation. To reduce collisions, we can multiply each value
used to compute hashwith some prime number raised to the power
(m-index in pattern).

Revisiting the example of "OWL" and "LOW" with this approach and taking
the value of prime number equal to 7,

	LOW maps to 76 + 79x7 + 87x7x7 = 4892
	OWL maps to 79 + 87x7 + 76x7x7 = 4412.

Therefore, collision has been avoided in this case.

Though less often, collisions might still occur. So, we still need to
compare strings once their hashes come out to be equal.

Now, suppose we need to calculate 3 character hash in string "SLOWLY".
Taking 7 as the prime number, we do so as follows,

	SLO maps to 83 + 76x7 + 79x7x7 = 4486

	LOW maps to ((4486-83)/7) + 87x7x7 = 4892 	
						(x(S)=83 and x(W)=87)

	OWL maps to ((4892-76)/7) + 76x7x7 = 4412	
						(x(L)=76)

	WLY maps to ((4412-79)/7) + 89x7x7 = 4980	
						(x(O)=79 and x(Y)=89)


Let us now consider an example.

	---------------------------------
	|     x				|
	|     |  = character mismatch	|
	|				|
	|     /				|
	|     |  = character match	|
	|				|
	---------------------------------

In case the length of pattern is large, hash values also become very
large. This can lead to memory consumption issues during computation.
To overcome this we can limit the maximum value of hash by dividing
all hash values from that limit and assigning the remainder as the
actual hash value, i.e.


	final hash value = computed hash % max limit of hash


Mark that this will increase the probability of encountering collisions.



The average case running time of this algorithm would be O(m+n).
O(m) is the time consumed in preprocessing the pattern, i.e.
calculating hash(pattern).
This algorithm is faster than naive algorithm primarily due to reduced
number of comparisons. Simplicity of the hash function should not be
compromised at the cost of improving the function to reduce collisions.
