		Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm

#################################################################

Analysis of Naive algorithm shows that a lot of useless comparisons
have been made. These can be reduced by utilizing information attained
by scanning the pattern in the pre-search phase.

For example, consider searching the following pattern in the text given
below,

Text = GTACGTCAGTACGTACGTAC
Pattern = GTACGTAC

n = length of text
m = length of pattern

	---------------------------------
	|     x				|
	|     |  = character mismatch	|
	|				|
	|     /				|
	|     |  = character match	|
	|				|
	---------------------------------


The first mismatch occurs at

		GTACGTC......
		//////x
		|||||||
		GTACGTAC

Now analyzing the part of the algorithm already compared, GTACGT, we can
infer that "GT" is the longest <b>proper suffix</b> of the pattern
substring which is also a <b>proper prefix</b>. From this, we can conclude
that substring which failed at comparison of (second occurrence of)
character A (marked as mismatch above), contains "GT" before mismatched
character, as is apparent in the text string above. So we can feel safe to
carry out next comparison between third character (character next to proper
prefix which is also a proper suffix of substring) of the pattern and the
mismatched character in the text.

		GTACGTCAGTACGTACGTAC
		//////x
		|||||||
		GTACGTAC
		~~~~~~

					first mismatch shown by "x"

					"GT" = proper prefix and proper
					suffix of underlined substring.

					Therefore, next comparison between
					mismatched character of text and
					character followed by proper prefix
					in pattern substring.

*********************************************************************

		GTACGTCAGTACGTACGTAC
		      x
		      |
		    GTACGTAC
		    ~~
					Mismatch occurred.

					No proper prefix which is also a
					proper suffix in the underlined
					pattern substring (already matched
					part of pattern).

					Therefore, next comparison occurs
					between mismatched character of text
					and first character of pattern.

*********************************************************************

		GTACGTCAGTACGTACGTAC
		      x
		      |
		      GTACGTAC

					Characters mismatched. Next comparison
					between first character of pattern and
					next to the current character of text.

*********************************************************************

		GTACGTCAGTACGTACGTAC
		       x
		       |
		       GTACGTAC

					Similar to last step.

*********************************************************************

		GTACGTCAGTACGTACGTAC
		        ////////
		        ||||||||
		        GTACGTAC
			~~~~~~~~

					All characters match, hence a match
					has been found.

					"GTAC" = proper prefix and proper
					suffix of underlined (matched)
					substring. Therefore, next comparison
					between next character encountered in
					text string and character followed by
					proper prefix in pattern substring.

*********************************************************************

		GTACGTCAGTACGTACGTAC
		                ////
		                ||||
		            GTACGTAC
			        ~~~~

					All remaining characters match, hence
					a match has been found.

					Comparison completes.

*********************************************************************

So, in this algorithm, we preprocess the pattern to know at each index "i"
if the pattern[0:i-1] string has a proper suffix substring which is also a
proper prefix substring of the the pattern[0:i-1] string.
Then, while comparing with the text, when a mismatch occurs, we use this
knowledge to safely skip a few comparisons by making the next comparison
between the mismatched character of text and the character next to the
proper prefix examined above.

In programmin languages, this can be achieved by preprocessing the pattern
and computing length of proper suffix of the pattern[0:i-1] string, for
each character "i", which is a proper prefix for the same string, and then
storing these values in an array of integers.

For the given 21 characters long pattern string, array will be built as
follows:

	 G  T  G  T  G  C  A  G  T  G  T  G  C  A  G  T  G  T  G  G  C

	[0....
	[0  0....
	[0  0  1....
	[0  0  1  2....
	[0  0  1  2  3....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12....
	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12  1....

	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12  1  0]

							(Array complete)

Therefore, the final array comes out to be,

	[0  0  1  2  3  0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12  1  0]


Now, let us consider an example for complete algorithm.

Text = GTAUGTACGTUGTAUGTAUGTAC
Pattern = GTAUGTAC

Preprocessing of pattern :

	 G T A U G T A C
	[0...
	[0 0...
	[0 0 0...
	[0 0 0 0...
	[0 0 0 0 1...
	[0 0 0 0 1 2...
	[0 0 0 0 1 2 3...

	[0 0 0 0 1 2 3 0]			(complete array)

					All remaining characters matched.

					Therefore, a match has been found.
					Also, searching has finished since
					we have reached the end of text.


*********************************************************************

The array built during preprocessing can be built in O(m) time. At most
2n-1 comparisons occur. So, the algorithm takes O(n+m) time to execute.
