			Newton Raphson Method

#################################################################


One quality, bisection method is notorious for is its order of
convergence. Linear convergence is very slow for calculation
of roots in most cases and Newton Raphson method is the best known 
alternative when speedup is the ultimate requirement. This method's
quadratic convergence can be linked to its involvement of the 
function's derivative in its calculation, which is known to 
converge much faster than the function itself.

A single initial guess is made for the valie of root x of function 
f(x).Along with f(x), its derivative (f'(x)) is also calculated. Then
value of x for i<sup>th</sup> iteration is calculated using the 
formula
		x<sub>i</sub> = x<sub>i-1</sub>-(<i>f(x)</i>/<i>f'(x)</i>)
	
A smart initial guess, well within the limits of the function and 
close to the actual value of root can help this method converge very fast.

Visually, tangent line is drawn at the curve on initial guess of x=x<sub>0</sub>.
The point at which the tangent line intersects the x-axis becomes 
the value of x<sub>1</sub> for next iteration, and so on. Computationally, 
the value of x<sub>0</sub> is guessed and x<sub>i</sub><sup>th</sup> values are calculated
using the formula given above till a value of x is close enough to 
the value of one of the roots of the equation within permissible 
error/approximation limits.

Suppose, f(x) = sin(x)

In the graph given below, point marked red is the value of x<sub>i-1</sub> and 
point marked blue (cyan) is the value of x<sub>i</sub>. The straight green 
line is the tangent to the curve f(x)=sin(x) at x=x<sub>i-1</sub> for ith iteration.<br>

The above plot 1.1 shows the first iteration of the algorithm. 
x<sub>0</sub> is the initial guess of pi/3. This gives us the 
abscissa of x<sub>1</sub> equal to 0.68. Since this is not close 
enough to the root, the program proceeds towards next iteration.<br>
<a href="./plots/plot2_2.png"><img src="./plots/plot2_2.png"></a><br>
Now, x<sub>2</sub> is considered for evaluation in the next iteration of the 
algorithm. As, can be seen, convergence towards the root is faster 
than in case of bisection method.

After further iterations in a similar manner, value of f(x<sub>i</sub>) approaches 
zero. When its value gets close enough to zero, within permissible 
limits of approximation of result (provided by user), the value of
that x<sub>i</sub> is returned as value of a root of the function.

<b>Drawbacks:</b>

1. Fast convergence comes at a price of uncertainity of finding 
the root. Bisection method was certain to give value of a root 
provided its presence in the interval. But, estimate of root 
can overshoot limits in certain cases of Newton Raphson method. 
For the above example, suppose the initial guess was x=pi/2. This 
case is depicted in the following graph.<br>
<a href="./plots/plot2_3.png"><img src="./plots/plot2_3.png"></a><br>
Here, value of x<sub>1</sub> cannot be determined for next iteration, thus failing 
the algorithm. Therefore, this method does not give desired results 
in case our guess is close to a local maxima or minima.

2. A bad choice of value of x can lead to repetition in values of x 
in the subsequent iterations. This way, we never get the value of root 
because we remain stuck in the loop, as shown in graph. Such oscillations 
between finite number of values is a common pitfall, most often 
encountered in quadratic polynomials.<br>

3. This method cannot be applied where the first derivative of the 
function cannot be determined or is discontinuous. Also, it fails 
when function is non-differentiable at root.

4. If the initial guess is not close enough to the root, the results 
achieved are not good enough. 

5. A minor fluctuation in the value of function at some point can cause 
our estimate to overshoot to large distances from root, thus diverging 
instead of converging. Similar anomaly occurs at the point of inflection. 
A point of inflection is a point on graph at which the shape of curve 
changes from convex to concave and vice versa.Overshooting of estimate 
occurs when such points are approached in a manner similar 
to that in case of a maxima or minima as shown in graphs.<br>
<a href="./plots/plot2_5.png"><img src="./plots/plot2_5.png"></a><br>
When the inflection point is approached, the estimate of root overshoots 
the limits.<br>

6. Division by zero may occur in cases where f'(x<sub>i</sub>)=0, resulting in error.

7. Sometimes, the root you might expect is not the one returned by the 
algorithm. Such are the cases of root jumping, as shown in graph below.
Points of evaluation where this phenomenon occurs are visualized 
using Newton fractals.
<a href="./plots/plot2_7.png"><img src="./plots/plot2_7.png"></a><br>
Although, the initial guess is closer to the root at x=0, after the first 
iteration, the estimate jumps to a point closer to the root at x=-pi.


An alternative to counter some of such situations is to make a combined use 
of bisection and Newton Raphson method. Bisection method is used to 
determine the bounds for value of x. Whenever, Newton Raphson method 
fails to get a <i>new</i> value of x within those bounds, bisection method 
is applied to get new bounds for Newton Raphson method to operate. 
A <i>new</i> value is required to avoid returning of same two roots alternately. 
Although this ascertains that a root will be returned if present, the
execution time of this algorithm will be slower than that of ordinary 
Newton Raphson method.

The Newton Raphson Method can also be extended to argand plane for finding 
roots of complex numbers. Their further analysis results in formation of 
fractals, an intersting topic for sometime later.
