			Newton Raphson Method

#################################################################


One quality, bisection method is notorious for is its order of
convergence. Linear convergence is very slow for calculation
of roots in most cases and Newton Raphson method is the best known 
alternative when speedup is the ultimate requirement. This method's
quadratic convergence can be linked to its involvement of the 
function's derivative in its calculation, which is known to 
converge much faster than the function itself.

A single initial guess is made for the valie of root x of function 
f(x).Along with f(x), its derivative (f'(x)) is also calculated. Then
value of x for i<sup>th</sup> iteration is calculated using the 
formula
		x<sub>i</sub> = x<sub>i-1</sub>-(<i>f(x)</i>/<i>f'(x)</i>)
	
A smart initial guess, well within the limits of the function can 
help thi method in converging very fast.

Visually, tangent line is drawn at the curve on initial guess of x=x<sub>0</sub>.
The point at which the tangent line intersects the x-axis becomes 
the value of x<sub>1</sub> for next iteration, and so on. Computationally, 
the value of x<sub>0</sub> is guessed and x<sub>i</sub><sup>th</sup> values are calculated
using the formula given above till a value of x is close enough to 
the value of one of the roots of the equation within permissible 
error/approximation limits.

Suppose, f(x) = sin(x)

In the graph given below, point marked red is the value of x<sub>i-1</sub> and 
point marked blue (cyan) is the value of x<sub>i</sub>. The straight green 
line is the tangent to the curve f(x)=sin(x) at x=x<sub>i-1</sub> for ith iteration.<br>

x<sub>0</sub> is the initial guess of pi/3. This gives us the 
abscissa of x<sub>1</sub> equal to 0.68. Since this is not close 
enough to the root, the program proceeds towards next iteration.<br>
