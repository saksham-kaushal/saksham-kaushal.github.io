			Newton Raphson Method

#################################################################


One quality, bisection method is notorious for is its order of
convergence. Linear convergence is very slow for calculation
of roots in most cases and Newton Raphson method is the best known 
alternative when speedup is the ultimate requirement. This method's
quadratic convergence can be linked to its involvement of the 
function's derivative in its calculation, which is known to 
converge much faster than the function itself.

A single initial guess is made for the valie of root x of function 
f(x).Along with f(x), its derivative (f'(x)) is also calculated. Then
value of x for i<sup>th</sup> iteration is calculated using the 
formula
		x<sub>i</sub> = x<sub>i-1</sub>-(<i>f(x)</i>/<i>f'(x)</i>)
	
A smart initial guess, well within the limits of the function can 
help thi method in converging very fast.

Visually, tangent line is drawn at the curve on initial guess of x=x<sub>0</sub>.
The point at which the tangent line intersects the x-axis becomes 
the value of x<sub>1</sub> for next iteration, and so on. Computationally, 
the value of x<sub>0</sub> is guessed and x<sub>i</sub><sup>th</sup> values are calculated
using the formula given above till a value of x is close enough to 
the value of one of the roots of the equation within permissible 
error/approximation limits.

Suppose, f(x) = sin(x)

In the graph given below, point marked red is the value of x<sub>i-1</sub> and 
point marked blue (cyan) is the value of x<sub>i</sub>. The straight green 
line is the tangent to the curve f(x)=sin(x) at x=x<sub>i-1</sub> for ith iteration.<br>

The above plot 1.1 shows the first iteration of the algorithm. 
x<sub>0</sub> is the initial guess of pi/3. This gives us the 
abscissa of x<sub>1</sub> equal to 0.68. Since this is not close 
enough to the root, the program proceeds towards next iteration.<br>

Now, x<sub>2</sub> is considered for evaluation in the next iteration of the 
algorithm. As, can be seen, convergence towards the root is faster 
than in case of bisection method.

After further iterations in a similar manner, value of f(x<sub>i</sub>) approaches 
zero. When its value gets close enough to zero, within permissible 
limits of approximation of result (provided by user), the value of
that x<sub>i</sub> is returned as value of a root of the function.

<b>Drawbacks:</b>

1. Fast convergence comes at a price of uncertainity of finding 
the root. Bisection method was certain to give value of a root 
provided its presence in the interval. But, evaluation of function 
can fly off the limits in certain cases of Newton Raphson method. 
For the above example, suppose the initial guess was x=pi/2. This 
case is depicted in the following graph.<br>
<a href="./plots/plot2_3.png"><img src="./plots/plot2_3.png"></a><br>
Here, value of x<sub>1</sub> cannot be determined for next iteration, thus failing 
the algorithm.

2. A bad choice of value of x can lead to repetition in values of x 
in the subsequent iterations. This way, we never get the value of root 
because we remain stuck in the loop, as shown in graph.<br>

An alternative to avoid such situations is to make a combined use of 
bisection and Newton Raphson method. Bisection method is used to 
determine the bounds for value of x. Whenever, Newton Raphson method 
fails to get a <i>new</i> value of x within those bounds, bisection method 
is applied to get new bounds for Newton Raphson method to operate. 
A <i>new</i> value is required to avoid returning of same two roots alternately. 
Although this ascertains that a root will be returned if present, the
execution time of this algorithm will be slower than that of ordinary 
Newton Raphson method.
